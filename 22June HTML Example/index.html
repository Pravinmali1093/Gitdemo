    <p><b><q><i>Computer science</i></q></b> is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans
        theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied
        disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).

        Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[7] The theory of computation concerns abstract
        models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography
        and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security
        vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming
        language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the
        management of repositories of data. Human computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans
        and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing
        software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design
        behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and
        computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated
        processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in
        humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and
        video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
